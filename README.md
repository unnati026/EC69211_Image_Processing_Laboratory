# EC69211: Image Processing Laboratory

This repository contains implementations of the seven experiments and a mini-project for the **Image and Video Processing Laboratory (EC69211)** course for Vision and Intelligent Systems specialisation at IIT Kharagpur.

### Experiments
1. **Image Scaling and Rotation** – Nearest neighbor and bilinear interpolation for resizing and rotating images.
2. **BMP Image Manipulation** – Reading, writing, and modifying BMP images.
3. **Frequency Domain Transformation** – Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and inverse FFT.
4. **Frequency Domain Filtering** – Low-pass and high-pass filters, hybrid images, and denoising.
5. **Spatial Domain Filtering** – Mean, median, edge detection (Sobel, Prewitt), Gaussian blur, and deblurring.
6. **Histogram Equalization and Matching** – Contrast enhancement and histogram-based transformations.
7. **Morphological Operations** – Erosion, dilation, opening, and closing for binary image processing.

### Mini-Project
- **JPEG Compression** – Implements RGB to YCbCr conversion, chroma subsampling, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), quantization, and entropy encoding for image compression.
